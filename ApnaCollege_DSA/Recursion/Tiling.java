/*
Problem Statement: Tiling Problem

You are given a floor of size 2 √ó n and tiles of size 2 √ó 1.
You need to count the number of ways to completely fill the floor with these tiles.

You can place each tile either:

Vertically (covering 2 rows and 1 column), or

Horizontally (covering 1 row and 2 columns).

Return the total number of ways to fill the floor.

üß† Example 1

Input:

n = 1


Output:

1


Explanation:
Only one way ‚Äî place one tile vertically.

üß† Example 2

Input:

n = 2


Output:

2


Explanation:
Two ways ‚Äî
1Ô∏è‚É£ Place two tiles vertically side by side.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Place two tiles horizontally stacked on top of each other.

üß† Example 3

Input:

n = 3


Output:

3


Explanation:
1Ô∏è‚É£ All vertical,
2Ô∏è‚É£ Two horizontal + one vertical,
3Ô∏è‚É£ One vertical + two horizontal.
