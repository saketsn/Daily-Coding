/*
Problem Statement

Given two strings, s1 and s2, your task is to find the minimum number of character deletions required to make the
two strings anagrams of each other.

Definition:
Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters with the same frequency, but possibly in a different order.

Rules:

You can only delete characters from either string.

You cannot add or replace characters.

Input:

Two strings s1 and s2 consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output:

An integer representing the minimum number of deletions required to make s1 and s2 anagrams.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "cde", s2 = "abc"
Output: 4
Explanation:
Delete 'd' and 'e' from "cde" and delete 'a' and 'b' from "abc".
Resulting strings: "c" and "c", which are anagrams.


Example 2:

Input: s1 = "aabbcc", s2 = "abccdd"
Output: 4
Explanation:
Delete 'a' and 'b' from "aabbcc" and delete 'd' and 'd' from "abccdd".
Resulting strings: "abcc" and "abcc", which are anagrams.


Constraints:

1 <= len(s1), len(s2) <= 10^5

Strings contain only lowercase letters aâ€“z.
